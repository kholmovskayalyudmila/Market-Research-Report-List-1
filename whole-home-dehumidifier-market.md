<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The whole-home dehumidifier market consists of two major types: ducted dehumidifiers and free-standing dehumidifiers. Ducted dehumidifiers are installed within the existing ductwork of the HVAC system. They work by extracting moisture from the air as it passes through the system, ensuring the entire home is effectively dehumidified. On the other hand, free-standing dehumidifiers are stand-alone units that can be placed in specific areas or rooms to remove excess moisture. They are often portable and more suitable for smaller spaces or localized humidity problems.</p></p>

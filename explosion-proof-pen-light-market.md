<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion proof Pen Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED</li><li>Ordinary Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion-proof pen light market consists of two main types: LED and ordinary. LED pen lights are equipped with light-emitting diodes which offer brighter and more energy-efficient illumination. These lights are highly durable and long-lasting. On the other hand, ordinary pen lights use standard bulbs and provide a less intense light. They are commonly used for basic lighting needs and are often less expensive compared to LED pen lights. Both types serve the purpose of providing illumination in potentially hazardous environments, but differ in terms of technology, brightness, and cost.</p></p>

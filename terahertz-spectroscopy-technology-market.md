<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Spectroscopy Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy</li><li>Terahertz Frequency Domain Spectroscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz spectroscopy technology encompasses two major market types: Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Terahertz Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (THz-FDS). In THz-TDS, the time delay of an ultrafast pulse caused by interaction with the sample is measured to obtain its spectral information. On the other hand, THz-FDS measures the change in intensity or phase of the terahertz wave after it passes through the sample. Both techniques are used for material analysis, pharmaceutical research, security screening, and other industrial applications due to their ability to provide detailed information about materials at the molecular level.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Greenhouse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroponic</li><li>Non-Hydroponic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the intelligent greenhouse market, there are two main types: hydroponic and non-hydroponic. Hydroponic greenhouse systems involve growing plants without the use of soil, instead using water and nutrient solutions. These systems are known for their efficient use of resources and high crop yields. On the other hand, non-hydroponic greenhouses rely on soil as a growing medium. While they may require more water and nutrients, they offer a more traditional approach to cultivation. Both market types offer innovative technologies to monitor and control environmental factors within the greenhouse for optimized plant growth.</p></p>

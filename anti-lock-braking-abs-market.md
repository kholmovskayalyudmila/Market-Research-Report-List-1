<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Lock Braking (ABS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sensors</li><li>ECU</li><li>Hydraulic Unit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti Lock Braking (ABS) market includes three main types: sensors, ECU (Electronic Control Unit), and hydraulic unit. Sensors in ABS monitor the speed of each wheel and transmit data to the ECU, which then analyzes the information and commands the hydraulic unit. The ECU acts as the brain of the ABS system, receiving and processing signals from sensors, and controlling the hydraulic unit to prevent wheel lock-up during braking. The hydraulic unit ensures that individual brakes are applied to maintain traction and directional control, enhancing vehicle safety.</p></p>

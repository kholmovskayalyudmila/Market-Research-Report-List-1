<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)</li><li>Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)</li><li>Adaptive Servo Ventilation (ASV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) machines are medical devices used to treat sleep apnea. There are three main types: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), and Adaptive Servo Ventilation (ASV). CPAP delivers a constant level of pressure throughout the breathing cycle, ensuring the airways stay open. BiPAP provides varying pressure levels during inhalation and exhalation, making it easier for patients with certain respiratory conditions to breathe. ASV adjusts pressure based on an individual's breathing patterns, adapting to their specific needs. These PAP machine types are designed to improve sleep quality and breathing for patients with sleep apnea.</p></p>

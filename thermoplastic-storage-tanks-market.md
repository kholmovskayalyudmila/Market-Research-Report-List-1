<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermoplastic Storage Tanks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Wall</li><li>Double Wall</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermoplastic storage tanks are commonly categorized into two types: single wall and double wall tanks. Single wall tanks consist of a single layer of thermoplastic material, making them more cost-effective but also more prone to leaks or environmental hazards in case of a failure. On the other hand, double wall tanks have an additional layer of thermoplastic material, providing an extra protective barrier against leaks or spills. This additional layer adds strength and durability to the tank, making it more reliable and safer for storing various types of liquids.</p></p>

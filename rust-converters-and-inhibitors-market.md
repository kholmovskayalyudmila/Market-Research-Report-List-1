<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rust Converters and Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rust converters are products that are used to convert rust into a stable, non-rusting surface. They come in different types, including spray and liquid forms. Spray rust converters are applied by spraying the product directly onto the rusted surface, while liquid rust converters are typically brushed or rolled onto the surface. These products work by chemically reacting with the rust, creating a protective barrier that prevents further corrosion. Rust inhibitors, on the other hand, are designed to prevent the formation of rust altogether. They can also be found in spray or liquid form and are applied to metal surfaces to inhibit the oxidation process that leads to rust formation.</p></p>

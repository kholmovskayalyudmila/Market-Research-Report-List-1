<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Brake Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proportional Brake Controllers</li><li>Time-Delayed Brake Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electric brake controllers are devices used to control the electric brakes of trailers or caravan when towing. Proportional brake controllers provide smooth and proportional braking by distributing the braking force based on the tow vehicle's braking intensity. They ensure a smoother and more controlled braking experience. Time-delayed brake controllers, on the other hand, have a pre-determined delay time before applying the brakes. They provide a constant output of power, making them simpler and less expensive, but less precise compared to proportional brake controllers. Both types serve the same purpose but differ in their braking mechanism.</p></p>

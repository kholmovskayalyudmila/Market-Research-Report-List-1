<p><strong>The Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition Thermal Barrier Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Layer</li><li>Double Layer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EBPVD) is a technique used to apply Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) on various surfaces. TBCs consist of either a Single Layer or a Double Layer coating. In the Single Layer market, a single ceramic layer is deposited directly on the surface to protect it from high temperatures. On the other hand, the Double Layer market involves the deposition of two successive ceramic layers â€“ a bond coat and a top coat. The bond coat provides adhesion to the surface, while the top coat acts as a thermal barrier.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds)</li><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) systems refer to medical devices used to treat heart failure by improving the synchronization of the heart's chambers. There are two types of CRT systems: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps). CRT-Ds are implanted devices that not only synchronize the heart's rhythm but also provide defibrillation to treat life-threatening arrhythmias. On the other hand, CRT-Ps are implanted devices that only synchronize the heart's rhythm without the defibrillation capability. Both systems aim to enhance the heart's pumping efficiency and improve the patient's quality of life.</p></p>

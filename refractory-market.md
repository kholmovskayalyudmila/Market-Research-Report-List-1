<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaped Refractories</li><li>Unshaped Refractories</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Refractory materials are used in various industries for their ability to withstand high temperatures and harsh conditions. There are two main types of refractory markets: shaped refractories and unshaped refractories. Shaped refractories are precast shapes, such as bricks, tiles, and blocks, which are manufactured in a specific shape and size before being installed. On the other hand, unshaped refractories are materials that are applied in a semi-fluid or plastic state, such as castables, mortars, and ramming mixes, and then shaped and solidified in place. Both types play crucial roles in providing heat resistance and protection in industrial applications.</p></p>

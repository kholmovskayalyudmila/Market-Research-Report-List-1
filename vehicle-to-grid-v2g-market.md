<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional V2G</li><li>Bidirectional V2G</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) refers to the technology that enables electric vehicles (EVs) to not only receive power from the grid but also send excess energy back to it. The market for V2G can be categorized into two types: unidirectional V2G and bidirectional V2G. Unidirectional V2G only allows energy flow from the grid to the EV, allowing the vehicle to charge. In contrast, bidirectional V2G enables energy flow in both directions, allowing the EV to not only charge but also discharge excess energy back to the grid, benefiting both the vehicle owner and the utility company.</p></p>

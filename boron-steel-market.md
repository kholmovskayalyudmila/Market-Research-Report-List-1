<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boron Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid (0.001%-0.005%)</li><li>Brittle (above0.007%)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boron steel is a type of steel that contains a small amount of boron, which enhances its strength and hardenability. Boron steel is classified into two main market types based on the concentration of boron: rigid and brittle. Rigid boron steel generally contains 0.001% to 0.005% boron and has excellent tensile strength, making it ideal for automotive applications where high strength and durability are required. On the other hand, brittle boron steel, with boron concentrations above 0.007%, has reduced ductility and is more prone to cracking, limiting its application in certain industries.</p></p>

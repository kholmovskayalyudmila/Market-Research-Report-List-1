<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-level liquid level switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multi-level liquid level switch market consists of two types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type switches work by physically coming into contact with the liquid to detect its level, typically using buoyancy principles or a float system. Non-contact type switches, on the other hand, use technologies like ultrasonic or capacitive sensing to detect the liquid level without any physical contact. Both types have their advantages and applications, and the market offers a variety of options to cater to different industries and liquid level detection requirements.</p></p>

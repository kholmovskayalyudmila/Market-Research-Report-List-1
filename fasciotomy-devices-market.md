<p><p>Fasciotomy devices are used in the treatment of compartment syndrome, a condition in which increased pressure within a muscular compartment restricts blood flow and can lead to tissue damage. Split-thickness skin grafts involve harvesting a thin layer of skin from a healthy donor site and transplanting it onto the damaged area. Negative pressure wound therapy promotes wound healing by applying suction to the wound, stimulating blood flow and removing excess fluids. Vessel loop techniques involve using flexible loops to temporarily occlude blood vessels during surgery. Continuous external tissue expansion involves stretching the surrounding tissue to create new skin for grafts. Other techniques include muscle flaps and bioengineered grafts.</p></p>

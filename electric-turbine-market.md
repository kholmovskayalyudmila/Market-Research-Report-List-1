<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Electric Turbine</li><li>Axial Flow Electric Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric turbine market comprises two main types: centrifugal electric turbines and axial flow electric turbines. Centrifugal electric turbines use centrifugal force to rotate the turbine blades, pushing air outwards from the center. These turbines are typically used in applications where high pressure and relatively low flow rates are required, such as in HVAC systems. On the other hand, axial flow electric turbines have blades that are positioned parallel to the rotational axis, allowing air to flow axially through the turbine. These turbines are commonly found in applications where high flow rates and lower pressure differentials are needed, such as in ventilation systems or wind turbines.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Airbag Inflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic</li><li>Stored Gas</li><li>Hybrid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile airbag inflators market is dominated by three types: pyrotechnic, stored gas, and hybrid. Pyrotechnic inflators use a small explosive charge to rapidly generate gas and inflate the airbag. Stored gas inflators rely on compressed gas stored in a canister to inflate the airbag. Hybrid inflators combine the two methods, using a small explosive charge to rupture a stored gas canister, accelerating the release of gas to inflate the airbag. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, with automakers choosing based on factors such as cost, performance, and safety considerations.</p></p>

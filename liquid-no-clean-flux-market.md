<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid No-Clean Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Residue</li><li>Extremely Low Residue</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The liquid no-clean flux market can be divided into two main types: low residue and extremely low residue. Low residue flux refers to a type of flux that leaves a moderate amount of residue on the surface after soldering. This residue is typically non-conductive and does not require cleaning. On the other hand, extremely low residue flux leaves a minimal amount of residue, almost negligible, after soldering. This type of flux is ideal for applications where high-level cleanliness is required, such as in electronic components and medical devices.</p></p>

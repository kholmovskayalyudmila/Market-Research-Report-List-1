<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coagulants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Coagulants</li><li>Inorganic Coagulants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Coagulants are chemicals used in various industries for water treatment and purification. The market for coagulants can be broadly categorized into two types: organic coagulants and inorganic coagulants. Organic coagulants are derived from natural sources and are generally biodegradable, making them environmentally friendly. On the other hand, inorganic coagulants are synthesized using mineral salts and often demonstrate higher stability and efficiency in water treatment processes. Both types play a vital role in coagulation and flocculation processes, helping to remove impurities and solids from water sources.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Coagulants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drinking Water Treatment</li><li>Wastewater Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Coagulants are commonly used in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater. In drinking water treatment, coagulants are added to destabilize and aggregate suspended particles, allowing them to settle or be filtered out. This helps to remove impurities and turbidity, ensuring safe and clear drinking water. Similarly, in wastewater treatment, coagulants aid in the removal of organic matter, heavy metals, and other contaminants, leading to improved water quality before it is discharged back into the environment. Overall, coagulants play a crucial role in enhancing the purification processes of both drinking water and wastewater treatment.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipelay Vessel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>J-lay Barges</li><li>S-lay Barges</li><li>Reel-lay Barges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pipelay vessels are specialized ships used in the offshore industry to install underwater pipelines. There are three main types: J-lay barges, S-lay barges, and Reel-lay barges. J-lay barges use a tower structure to vertically lower and lay the pipeline on the seabed. S-lay barges use a curved stinger to bend the pipeline into a J-shape and lower it onto the seabed. Reel-lay barges unwind the pipeline from large reels and lay it directly onto the seabed. Each vessel type has its own advantages and is chosen based on project requirements and seabed conditions.</p></p>

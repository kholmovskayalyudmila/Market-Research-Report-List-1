<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automated Hydroponic Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Closed System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fully Automated Hydroponic Systems are classified into two types: Open System and Closed System. </p><p>An Open System allows the nutrient solution to flow in and out of the growing trays, continuously delivering fresh nutrients to the plants. This system requires constant monitoring and adjustment to maintain the correct nutrient balance.</p><p>On the other hand, a Closed System recirculates the nutrient solution, preventing any flow in or out of the trays. This system conserves water and nutrients, reducing waste and costs. However, regular monitoring and adjustments are still necessary to ensure optimal plant growth.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Composite Leaf Springs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transversal</li><li>Longitudinal</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive composite leaf springs market consists of two main types: transversal and longitudinal. Transversal leaf springs are positioned in a crosswise manner to support the vehicle's weight, providing stability and reducing body roll. These leaf springs are commonly found in the rear suspension of vehicles. On the other hand, longitudinal leaf springs are positioned lengthwise in the vehicle, typically used in the front suspension. They help in absorbing shocks and impacts, ensuring a smooth ride. Both types contribute to improving the overall performance and handling of automobiles.</p></p>
